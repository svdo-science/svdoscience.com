## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the interwebs, [svdoscience.com](https://svdoscience.com)!

My name is Joel, and while at work I am a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET), I'm generally interested in all things code.

My work experience comes from my time at Google, GoodRx, and Ticketmaster.

I like to keep my eyes out for new technologies, take them for a spin, and then write about my experiences with them when I can remember to do so ðŸ˜…

Keep an eye out for new blog posts, and maybe eventually videos!
